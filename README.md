# 🍽️ Eatzy – Online Food Ordering and Delivery System

**Eatzy** is a full-stack portfolio project that simulates a modern online food ordering platform. It allows customers to browse food items, place orders, and make payments, while restaurant owners manage their menus, events, and orders through a dedicated dashboard.

Built using **Spring Boot (backend)** and **React (frontend)**, this project highlights my ability to create secure, scalable, and user-friendly web applications.
